# alu-AirBnB_clone
The AirBnB Clone Project is a simplified version of the AirBnB website, aimed at covering key concepts of higher-level programming. It includes four main components: a command-line interpreter for manipulating data (ideal for development and debugging), a front-end static and dynamic website that simulates the AirBnB platform, data storage using either a file system (JSON) or a database (SQLite/MySQL), and a RESTful API built with Flask to enable communication between the front-end and back-end. The project demonstrates an understanding of web development, back-end, front-end, storage management, and API integration. Technologies used include Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and Git. To run the project, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies.i:i
